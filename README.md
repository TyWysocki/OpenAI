# Swift Client Library - OpenAI API

A Swift client library designed to help you interact with the OpenAI HTTP APIs. More information on the API can be found here: https://beta.openai.com/docs

## Installation üíª

To integrate the library, Swift Package Manager is your tool of choice. Add the following dependency to your Package.swift file or add it directly within Xcode.

`
.Package(url: "https://github.com/tywysocki/OpenAI.git", from: "1.0.0")
`

## Usage üë©‚Äçüíª

Import the library:

```swift
import OpenAI
```

Create an API key [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys), and include it in your configuration.

```swift
let client = OpenAI(authToken:"API_KEY")
```

With this library, you can take advantage of Swift concurrency. The code snippets provided below demonstrate both async/await and completion handler implementations.


### [Text Completion](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) üí¨

Use `client.sendCompletion` to generate a text completion that aims to correspond with the given context or pattern in the prompt.

#### Completion handler implementation:

```swift
client.sendCompletion(with: "How are you doing today") { result in // Result<OpenAIModel, OpenAIError>
    switch result {
    case .success(let success):
        print(success.choices.first?.text ?? "")
    case .failure(let failure):
        print(failure.localizedDescription)
    }
}
```
To implement the completion handler, you need to provide a string parameter (the prompt) and a closure that will be called with a `Result` object. If the API call is successful, an `OpenAIModel` object will be returned. If the API call fails, an `OpenAIError` object will be returned.

#### async/await implementation:

```swift
do {
    let result = try await client.sendCompletion(
        with: "Got any creative names for my new dog?",
        model: .gpt3(.davinci), // optional `OpenAIModelType`
        maxTokens: 16,          // optional `Int?`
        temperature: 1          // optional `Double?`
    )
    // use result
} catch {
    // ...
}
```

The `async/await` implementation waits for the completion to be generated before continuing with the code execution. After the completion is generated, it will be stored in `result`, which can then be used in the code for further processing, such as displaying the generated name to the user. If the completion generation fails, the code will catch the error and handle it appropriately in the catch block.

You can specify the model to be used with the `model` parameter. For a list of supported models, see [OpenAIModelType.swift](https://github.com/tywysocki/OpenAI/blob/master/Sources/OpenAI/Models/OpenAIModelType.swift). The [OpenAI API Docs](https://beta.openai.com/docs/models) has addtional information on the models.

### [Chat Completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) ü§ñ

Use `client.sendChat` to access ChatGPT (aka GPT-3.5) and GPT-4 (currently in beta) to generate responses for chat conversations. Chat models take a series of messages as input, and return a model-generated message as output.

#### Example API call:

```swift
do {
    let chat: [ChatMessage] = [
        ChatMessage(role: .system, content: "You are a helpful assistant."),
        ChatMessage(role: .user, content: "Who played in the 30th Super Bowl?"),
        ChatMessage(role: .assistant, content: "The 30th Super Bowl was played between the Dallas Cowboys and the Pittsburgh Steelers."),
        ChatMessage(role: .user, content: "Who won the game?")
    ]
                
    let result = try await client.sendChat(with: chat)
    // use result
} catch {
    // ...
}
```

Each `ChatMessage` object in `chat` has a `role` (either "system", "user", or "assistant") and `content` (the content of the message). Conversations are typically formatted with a system message first (helps set the behavior of the assistant) and followed by alternating user and assistant messages.

####All API parameters are supported, except streaming message content before it is completed:

```swift
do {
    let chat: [ChatMessage] = [...]

    let result = try await client.sendChat(
        with: chat,
        model: .chat(.chatgpt),         // optional `OpenAIModelType`
        user: nil,                      // optional `String?`
        temperature: 1,                 // optional `Double?`
        topProbabilityMass: 1,          // optional `Double?`
        choices: 1,                     // optional `Int?`
        stop: nil,                      // optional `[String]?`
        maxTokens: nil,                 // optional `Int?`
        presencePenalty: nil,           // optional `Double?`
        frequencyPenalty: nil,          // optional `Double?`
        logitBias: nil                  // optional `[Int: Double]?`
    )
    // use result
} catch {
    // ...
}
```

### [Image Generation - DALL¬∑E](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images/create) üñºÔ∏è

Use `client.sendImages` to generate an original image given a text prompt. Provide more detail in the prompt for better results.

```swift
client.sendImages(with: "Hand drawn sketch of a Porsche 911.", numImages: 1, size: .size1024) { result in // Result<OpenAIModel, OpenAIError>
    switch result {
    case .success(let success):
        print(success.data.first?.url ?? "")
    case .failure(let failure):
        print(failure.localizedDescription)
    }
}
```

### [Edits](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/edits) ‚úçÔ∏è

Use `client.sendEdits` to edit text based on a prompt and an instruction for how to modify it.

```swift
do {
    let result = try await client.sendEdits(
        with: "Fix the spelling mistake.",
        model: .feature(.davinci),               // optional `OpenAIModelType`
        input: "Me name is Ty"
    )
    // use result
} catch {
    // ...
}
```

### [Moderation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/moderations) üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Use `client.sendModeration` to check whether content complies with OpenAI's usage policies.

```swift
do {
    let result = try await client.sendModeration(
        with: "Unmoderated text",
        model: .moderation(.latest)     // optional `OpenAIModelType`
    )
    // use result
} catch {
    // ...
}
```
