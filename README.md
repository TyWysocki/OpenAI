# OpenAI API Client Library (Swift)  

This library will allow you to access the OpenAI HTTP APIs. You can read the [full API docs](https://beta.openai.com/docs) for additional information.

## Installing OpenAI  üíª

Add the following dependency in your Package.swift file (use Swift Package Manager):

`.Package(url:"https://github.com/tywysocki/OpenAI.git", majorVersion: 1)`

## Usage üë®‚Äçüíª

Import the module into your application.

`import OpenAI`

Set your API token after creating one [here](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys).

`let openAPI = OpenAI(authToken:"TOKEN")`

Create a call to the completions API, passing in a text prompt.

```swift
openAI.sendCompletion(with: "Hello, how are you today?", maxTokens: 100) { result in // Result<OpenAI, OpenAIError>
    switch result {
    case .success(let success):
        print(success.choices.first?.text ?? "")
    case .failure(let failure):
        print(failure.localizedDescription)
    }
}
```
The API will return an `OpenAPI` object that contains the corresponding text items.

You can specify different models to use for the completions (The `sendCompletion` method defaults to the `text-davinci-003` model).

```swift
openAI.sendCompletion(with: "A random emoji", model: .gpt3(.ada)) { result in // Result<OpenAI, OpenAIError>
    // switch on result to get the response or error
}
```
See [OpenAIModelType.swift](https://github.com/tywysocki/OpenAI/blob/master/Sources/OpenAI/Models/OpenAIModelType.swift) for a list of supported models and the [OpenAI API Documentation](https://beta.openai.com/docs/models) for more information on the models.

OpenAI supports Swift concurrency, you can use Swift‚Äôs async/await syntax to fetch completions.

```swift
do {
    let result = try await openAI.sendCompletion(with: "A random emoji")
} catch {
    print(error.localizedDescription)
}
```

The latest `gpt-3.5-turbo` model is also available: 

```swift
func chat() async {
    do {
        let chat: [ChatMessage] = [
            ChatMessage(role: .system, content: "You are a helpful assistant."),
            ChatMessage(role: .user, content: "What teams played in the 30th Superbowl?"),
            ChatMessage(role: .assistant, content: "The Dallas Cowboys played the Pittsburgh Steelers in the 30th Superbowl."),
            ChatMessage(role: .user, content: "Who won?")
        ]
                    
        let result = try await openAI.sendChat(with: chat)
        
        print(result.choices.first?.message?.content ?? "Nothing")
    } catch {
        print("Something went wrong")
    }
}
```
