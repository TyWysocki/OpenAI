# OpenAI API Client Library (Swift)  üè´

This library will allow you to access the OpenAI HTTP API's. Read the [APdocs](https://beta.openai.com/docs) for additional information.


## Installing OpenAI  üíª

Use Swift Package Manager to integrate the library by adding the following dependency in your Package.swift file:

`.Package(url: "https://github.com/TyWysocki/OpenAI.git", majorVersion: 1)`


## Usage üë®‚Äçüíª

Import the module into your application.

`import OpenAI`

Set your API token after creating one [here](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys).

`let openAPI = OpenAISwift(authToken:"TOKEN")`

Create a call to the completions API to pass in a text prompt.

```swift
openAPI.sendCompletion(with: "Example") { result in // Result<OpenAIModel, OpenAIError>
    // switch on result to get the response or error
}
```
The API will return an `OpenAPI` object that contains the corresponding text items.

Different models can be specified and used for completions. The `sendCompletion` method defaults to the `text-davinci-003` model.

```swift
openAPI.sendCompletion(with: "Example", model: .gpt3(.ada)) { result in // Result<OpenAIModel, OpenAIError>
    // switch on result to get the response or error
}
...
```
Use Swift‚Äôs async/await syntax to fetch completions.

```swift
do {
    let result = try await openAPI.sendCompletion(with: "Example")
} catch {
    print(error.localizedDescription)
}
```
